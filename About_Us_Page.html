  <h1>About Us Page</h1>
  <p style="text-align:justify" >Our job typically begins with understanding the requirements of the software project. We work with stakeholders to identify 
  what the software needs to do, what features it should have, and what technologies should be used to build it. We then use this
  information to design the software architecture, which involves creating a blueprint of how the different components of the 
  software will interact with each other.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify" >The aim of this project is to help parents and children expand their knowledge, interests, and
	abilities outside of the classroom. This project provides extracurricular activities for kids to
	have a variety of positive effects, including improving their academic achievement, and the
	website will also suggest some activities for them.
	Muscat School Activities is a website that helps the students learn about and experience
	the activities firsthand, with the help of the school, to motivate them to be active and not
	stay inactive. Many children are not familiar with how activities work or what activities
	are in general, and this is where our project comes from. The website contains several
	activities for children to explore new skills and enhance their existing abilities without
	getting bored, to find what is suitable for them at a young age.</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify" >This project is going to be based on two main languages: Hyper Text Markup Language
	(HTML) for the website shape and form of the pages, structure modules, and Hypertext
	Preprocessor (PHP) to support the website forms, tables, and database (SQL). After that,
	we are using two secondary languages: Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) for the design and
	colors of the pages and fonts to help the project be spotless and attractive, and Java Script
	(JS) to help us use the functions and motions in a smooth and effective way so the website
	can be fast and responsive to the user and the society.</p>
