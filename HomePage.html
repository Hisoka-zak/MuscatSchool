Muscat School Activities is a website that helps the students learn about and experience
the activities firsthand, with the help of the school, to motivate them to be active and not
stay inactive. Many children are not familiar with how activities work or what activities
are in general, and this is where our project comes from. The website contains several
activities for children to explore new skills and enhance their existing abilities without
getting bored, to find what is suitable for them at a young age.
As a school, we need to prepare our students from the ages of eight to thirteen for the future,
so they know what they like, want, and need to be as adults. The project trains and teaches
the students many activities so they can try them themselves.
<br><br>
The system is going to be available 24 hours a day, all week. The website registration is
going to ask the parents or student for the following information: student name, ID,
password, email, age, class, and phone number. This information is going to be saved to
the student's file. The student will have to log in to the website with their student ID and
password. Then the home page will show the latest activities that are available and will
give him/her next week's activities too.
<br><br>
They can book any activity and choose the day and time that are suitable for them. If the
activity must be paid for, they can choose if they want online payment or walk-in payment.
The booking details will be stored in the booking file, and after the booking have been
approved, the student will get an email with all the details to confirm his or her booking.
An SMS will be sent to the parent to give all the information and the timing of the sessions,
and they can give a feedback comment on the website after the sessions are done.
